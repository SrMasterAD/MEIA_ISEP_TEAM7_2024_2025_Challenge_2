Chardonnay,Bread & Butter,"This really does what it says on the tin. It's a lush Chardonnay which tastes of – you guessed it – bread and butter. The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It's silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It's incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,USA,10.1,"Vanilla, Almond, Coconut, Green Apple, Peach, Pineapple, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.50%,California,Rich & Toasty,2021,Napa Valley,High
Pinot Noir,Bread & Butter,"Bread & Butter is that thing that you can count on. It's dependable, comforting – you know what to expect. That's exactly what you'll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It's sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It's exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It's all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It's seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes.

Rioja Reserva,Marqués de Riscal,"Marqués de Riscal made Rioja what it is today. Up until the 1850s the locals had made only light, young wines. Then, in 1858, Riscal introduced the 'Bordeaux method', barrel ageing. From that moment on, the practice became integral to Rioja. Today, Riscal Reserva is one of the most famous wines in Spain. Each grape is selected from vines that are at least 50 years old. Mature vines make the tastiest grapes. So the wine is incredibly rich and concentrated.

Gavi,La Toledana,"Gian Battista Cambiaso planted the very first Cortese vines in Gavi 400 years ago. The dry white wine he produced was the first recorded in the region, and his Castello La Toledana is one of the very few Genoese noble houses still standing today.

Pinot Noir,The Ned,"Marlborough Pinot Noir is a bit of an unsung gem. It's often overshadowed by its regional sister, Sauvignon Blanc – but we think it's fantastic if you love deeply fruity, silky reds.

The grapes ripen slowly, developing really concentrated, berry-fruit flavours which are a trademark of the Marlborough style. Added to which, Brent Marris is the master of Marlborough – he knows how to get the very best out of his grapes in these famous valleys. It's a real corker of the wine. Ripe. Juicy. Fruity.

Shiraz,Cape Mentelle,"Cape Mentelle is one of Margaret River's 'founding five' wineries. A benchmark for quality, they're celebrated for having pioneered many of this Western Australian wine region's renowned styles.

A cooler coastal influence results in a more restrained style than the bold-and-jammy Shiraz of Barossa and Mclaren Vale. In a nod towards the traditional Syrah blends of the Rhône Valley's Côte-Rôtie, winemaker Eloise Jarvis blends her red Shiraz grapes with white Viognier to dial up the complexity. Viognier is rich and aromatic, so adding it to a blend brings freshness, softens tannins, and enhances any fruity and floral notes. Côte-Rôtie wines usually come with lofty prices, but this Cape Mentelle favourite means you can enjoy the style at a fraction of the cost. Expect a complex and structured wine with layers of violets, dark forest fruits and wild cherries.

It's a masterclass in ageing, spending 36 months in oak before further resting in the bottle. The long maturation gives it incredible structure and complexity. Full. Smooth. Supple.

Produced from decades-old vines, this complex Merlot is aged for 18 months in oak before it's released. Its intense flavour and structure means it can age for up to another decade or more – so it's no surprise leading critic Tim Atkin awarded it 91 points.

Chardonnay,Hamilton Russell Vineyards,"Hamilton Russell Vineyards boasts a lot of superlatives. They're one of the most southerly vineyards in Africa. They were pioneers in now-celebrated Hemel-en-Aarde Valley, producing the first vintage back in 1981. And they're one of South Africa's finest wineries, often compared to the finest of Burgundy. Thanks to their southerly spot, they have a cool climate that's perfect for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. They keep yields small on the vineyard, and intense demand keeps these elegant estate-grown wines in short supply. When you taste this Chardonnay, you'll see what the fuss is about. It has prominent pear and lime notes, bright natural acidity, a hint of oak and a refreshing minerality. It's textured, intense and certainly not lacking personality.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Les Grandes Serres,"In the early 1920s, Châteauneuf-du-Pape was awash with substandard wines. So, the region decided to introduce some controls – specifying grape varieties and growing guidelines – which would guarantee consistent quality. It worked so well it inspired the whole French appellation contrôlée system – proof that pushing the bounds of convention can give great rewards. That's Les Grandes Serres' ethos. They keep their yields even lower, and harvest even later than is standard in Châteauneuf, determined to make their wines better and better. This wine is a case in point.
