In 1964, he set off on his bicycle with a selection of bottles strapped to his back. He pedalled around some of the most celebrated French restaurateurs of the day and they all loved the food-friendly wines. Georgesâ€™ success inspired him to expand the family business and build relationships with some of the best growers in Beaujolais.

"Edna Valley Chardonnay 2019/20, Central Coast","Edna Valley's vineyards are just a stoneâ€™s throw from the Californian coast, an area that's famous for its top-quality Chardonnay. You'll find big names like Napa and Sonoma nearby, but Edna Valley Vineyard choose to work within lesser-known wine regions instead â€“ meaning they're where to go for quality and value. White peach. Apricot. Melon. The flavours are seriously ripe, but itâ€™s still deliciously crisp and refreshing. A touch of oak adds a rich roundness and subtle spice, making it a perfect match for buttery pumpkin ravioli.",Â£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,USA,10.5,"Vanilla, Cream, Green Apple, Peach",per bottle,White,ABV 14.00%,California,Rich & Toasty,2020,Central Coast
"Paul Jaboulet AÃ®nÃ© Viognier 2021/22, France","Caroline Frey earned her stripes in the cellars of top Champagne crus and Bordeaux chÃ¢teaux, but taking over such an established label as Jaboulet was still no mean feat. Known for sublime reds, and Â£40-a-bottle Condrieu, Jaboulet is nothing less than a cult RhÃ´ne wine label. And this Viognier is a real steal. It's pure indulgence. A Condrieu doppelgÃ¤nger at a fraction of the price. It's aromatic. It's peachy. But it's also seriously fresh. Every part of the winemaking, from picking the very best grapes, to fermenting the juice in aroma-preserving stainless steel, has been designed to make this as opulent and fragrant a glassful as you could wish for.

"Surani 'Costarossa' Primitivo di Manduria DOC 2021/22, Puglia","If you love ripe, bold reds then this is an absolute must-try. We think Puglia is underrated. Itâ€™s right in the heel of Italyâ€™s boot â€“ and youâ€™d be forgiven for thinking the sun-baked vines could never produce a wine as silky and soft as this. But itâ€™s precisely that heat that Primitivo loves. The grapes are left on the vines until theyâ€™re almost overripe â€“ giving the flavours incredible concentration. Intense. Velvety. Ripe. Itâ€™s full of plummy, red-fruit flavour with moreish spice. Ageing in oak for a year gives it an extra dimension of flavour, smoothing the plush tannins.

The nearby Pacific ocean provides an almost constant breeze through the vineyards. This keeps fussy Pinot Noir grapes happy through a long growing season. And slow ripening grapes make complex and elegant wines. Central Coast may not grab the headlines like other nearby regions, but this means you get both great value and exceptional flavour. It's light and silky, with flavours of blackberry compote, black cherry, cranberry and a long, smooth finish.

Domaine Louis Moreau Petit Chablis 2021/22,"Chablis may be part of Burgundy â€“ but you wonâ€™t find any Pinot Noir vines here. Itâ€™s all about Chardonnay. Specifically: crisp, citrussy, refreshing Chardonnay. Chablis is a lot further north than the rest of Burgundy so has a cooler climate. This, combined with the tradition of leaving the majority of wines unoaked means that the style of these lean, light white Burgundys are very different from their rich, fruity southern cousins. It takes a real expert to hit the balance of freshness and flavour. Luckily, Domaine Louis Moreau have been doing it for six generations. This Petit Chablis is absolutely textbook. Itâ€™s crisp. Itâ€™s citrussy. Itâ€™s wonderfully fresh. Itâ€™s all about that classic appley, lemony Chardonnay fruit â€“ and itâ€™s a fantastic palate-cleanser.

Plentiful sunlight and cool nights here mean Malbec grapes with plenty of delicious fruit flavour. Expect flavours of blackcurrant, ripe plum and spice.

The Perrin family are behind legendary the ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape estate, ChÃ¢teau de Beaucastel. ChÃ¢teauneuf is a blend of thirteen grapes â€“ so you know that brothers Jean-Pierre and Francois are absolute masters of blending. They were the ideal partners for our buyers to work with to select the very best grapes, and then blend them to perfection. The result? Itâ€™s a juicy, moreish CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne. Proof that weâ€™ll only put our names to the best of the best â€“ thatâ€™s the Definition promise. Itâ€™s full of flavour â€“ redcurrant, peppery spice, plum â€“ with a soft, silky texture.

It seemed impossible to improve on it. But we had a feeling that if Porta 6 is an exceptional wine â€“ we could make a truly extraordinary one. We challenged the producer to go into the vineyards and root out the very best parcels of grapes. What they discovered were grapes of such incredible quality they warranted extra special care and attention. They handpicked and carefully sorted the grapes, then slowly aged the wine in oak barrels. The resulting wine is richly fruity with a twist of charred BBQ spice â€“ itâ€™s like Porta 6 but smoother, richer and even more delicious.

"Silver Ghost Sauvignon Blanc 2022/23, Central Valley","Just because itâ€™s inexpensive, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not great quality. This wine is actually made for us by one of the most prestigious winemaking families in Chile, the Arestis. They know how to get the very best peachy, citrussy flavours out of their grapes, while still keeping prices wallet-friendly. The Central Valley, where this wine is from, is cool but has loads of sunshine â€“ so this is more like a ripe white Bordeaux than a full, tropically fruity Kiwi Sauvignon. The fact is, Chilean wines are just incredible value â€“ a wine of this quality from another country could cost far more. In our book, that makes it the ideal party wine. Itâ€™s got a real citrussy zing and great tropical flavours. Itâ€™s incredibly refreshing, so your guests will be happy to drink it alone, or with finger foods.

There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and thereâ€™s no compromise on quality.

Montagnyâ€™s limestone soils mean the wines are fresh, with a fuller body than other Chalonnaise wines. The fruit flavours are really pronounced â€“ a factor amped up by the fact that itâ€™s â€˜Vielles Vignesâ€™. Itâ€™s made using grapes from thirty-year-old vines. Because theyâ€™re old, they only yield small amounts of grapes â€“ so all the flavour is exceptionally concentrated. Think ripe apple, citrus and white blossom.

"Definition Malbec 2021/22, Mendoza","Argentine Malbec is so popular, few people realise the grape is actually native to France. Mendoza, Argentinaâ€™s Malbec-heartland, is the place to look for the style of lush, fruity Malbec which put Argentina on the map. So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to our Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley â€“ a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we sourced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flavours. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness.

But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. Theyâ€™re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. Thatâ€™s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees â€“ giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flavours, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb.

"Definition Chenin Blanc 2021/22, South Africa","Chenin is a bit of a South African speciality â€“ and nobody does it better than DeMorgenzon. So, it was natural that weâ€™d source grapes for our Definition Chenin from them. Chenin is a lot like Chardonnay: it really picks up the character of its terroir.

Veuve Clicquot 'La Grande Dame' 2012/15 Champagne,"Veuve Clicquot is one of the most popular Champagne brands in the world, and its success is largely down to one woman: Barbe-Nicole Clicquot-Ponsardin. Madame Clicquot's innovative thinking saw her invent winemaking techniques that are still used in Champagne today. So it's no wonder her influence earned her the title of 'La Grande Dame de la Champagne'. This Pinot Noir-dominant cuvÃ©e was created in 1972 to honour the 'Great Lady' â€“ and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house. Madame Clicquot believed that Pinot Noir had the broadest range of expression and potential to create the best Champagnes. Veuve's current cellar master, Didier Mariotti, wholeheartedly agrees and the grape now accounts for up to 90 percent of the blend. He sums up this prestigious wine as  â€˜structured and texturedâ€™. With such exquisite flavour and complexity, weâ€™re certain youâ€™ll find popping its cork a memorable event. Expect fine bubbles that are delicately creamy, with lively notes of ripe lemon, rye bread and a hint of smokiness. Its incredibly fresh, making every sip mouthwatering.

Perfect for everyday and versatile enough to work in any situation, with almost any food. But we didnâ€™t want to settle for just any old wine. We challenged our buyers to find the very best wine they could at this price point. And they donâ€™t do things by halves. They tasted more than fifty Pinot Grigios before they settled on this as the very best quality for the money. We think they hit the nail on the head. Itâ€™s citrussy. Itâ€™s peachy.

Itâ€™s known as the birthplace of the AlbariÃ±o grape â€“ and itâ€™s the coolest and wettest part of the region. It means the AlbariÃ±os from here are extra crisp and green-fruity. They age this on the lees which gives the wine even more complexity and a lovely viscous texture which works incredibly with all those zingy, citrussy flavours. Itâ€™s a really special, unusual AlbariÃ±o which is perfect if you love both crisp whites and richer styles of wine. But thereâ€™s a catch. Only 1,100 cases of this wine were made â€“ so be quick.

"Meerlust Merlot 2017/18, Stellenbosch","Long recognised for producing premium wines, Meerlust Estate has a winemaking history dating back to 1756. They were pioneers of Bordeaux varietals in the Cape, producing Bordeaux-style blends with a unique South African flair. Meerlust means â€˜pleasure of the seaâ€™, as the vineyards are refreshed by ocean breezes and evening mists which roll in from the coast. This allows the grapes to ripen slowly, developing complex flavours but retaining freshness too. Produced from decades-old vines, this complex Merlot is aged for 18 months in oak before itâ€™s released. Its intense flavour and structure means it can age for up to another decade or more â€“ so itâ€™s no surprise leading critic Tim Atkin awarded it 91 points.

Its silky tannins and rich flavours make it a great match for red meats.",Â£26.99 per bottle,75CL,Merlot,,Natural Cork,South Africa,10.5,,per bottle,Red,ABV 14.00%,Stellenbosch,,2018,
Grato Grati â€˜Vecchia Annataâ€™ Rosso Toscana 1999,"Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG â€“ Chiantiâ€™s most northerly subzone â€“ and the area renowned for making the regionâ€™s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity â€“ and itâ€™s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family canâ€™t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuvÃ©es, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but donâ€™t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release.

Their wines are reminiscent of Condrieu, the finest and most expensive expression of Viognier, but come without the usual price tag. This is named 'Grande RÃ©serve' for good reason â€“ once it's aged in oak for ten months, it's not released until it's spent a further year in the bottle. As a result, it's truly indulgent.

Vigneti del Salento â€˜Zollaâ€™ Primitivo di Manduria DOC Riserva 2017,"The Farnese Group was founded in 1994 with the aim to be leaders of a renaissance in Italy's wine scene. 200 gold medals and countless accolades later, and they've been named Italian Producer of the Year four times. It's safe to say they've achieved their goal. This wine is sourced from their vineyards, where low-yielding vines ripen intensely flavoured grapes. The naturally dark-skinned Primitivo grapes give this wine a deep, inky colour, and ageing for 12 months in French oak has given it a rounded structure. If you like our Surani Primitivo, this is a great next step. Expect notes of violets, blackberries and cherries in each sip.

"Villa Belinda 2018/19, UclÃ©s DO","UclÃ©s is the Spanish DO youâ€™ve probably never heard of. But we canâ€™t keep a juicy insider-secret to ourselves â€“ so take this wine as our introduction to this up-and-coming denominaciÃ³n de origen. UclÃ©s is in Castile, Spainâ€™s central plateau which is most famous as the setting for Don Quioxte. Grapes are chosen from old vines which only yield a tiny number of grapes. But what they do yield has incredibly concentrated flavours. And because UclÃ©s is at high-altitude, those rich fruit flavours are married with real freshness, so the wineâ€™s velvety rather than jammy. Full-bodied. Juicy. Plush. Itâ€™s full of blackcurrant and plum aromas, with a delicious savoury kick of black pepper and woody herbs. Such richness makes it ideal with roasted or char-grilled meats.",Â£10.99 per bottle,75CL,Tempranillo,"Syrah, Garnacha",Natural Cork,Spain,10.9,"Chocolate, Black Pepper, Blackberry",per bottle,Red,ABV 14.50%,,Rich & Juicy,2019,

"Villa Tuccia Rosso, Italy","Chieti in Abruzzo is one of the largest wine-producing provinces in Italy. Codice Citra was established in the 1970s with quality, not quantity in mind. Grapes are estate-grown and bottled from a collection of just 9 family-owned vineyards. Vines thrive in this area thanks to the unique climate. Warm winds blow in from the Adriatic sea, meeting the cooler air flowing down from the Majela mountains. The locals refer to the resulting valley breeze as â€˜brezza di terraâ€™ â€“ and itâ€™s this that encourages perfect grape ripening. This blend of local grape varieties is bold and juicy.
